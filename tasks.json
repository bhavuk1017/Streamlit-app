The task aims to evaluate the candidate's understanding of C++ fundamentals, data structures, file handling, and error handling.\n\n**Task Description:**\nCreate a console-based application in C++ that simulates a simple library management system. The system should allow users to perform the following operations:\n\n1. Add a book to the library\n2. Remove a book from the library\n3. Search for a book by title or author\n4. Display all books in the library\n5. Save and load the library data from a file\n\n**Requirements:**\n\n1. The application should use a `Book` struct to represent a book, containing the following members:\n\t* `title`: a string representing the book title\n\t* `author`: a string representing the book author\n\t* `isbn`: a string representing the book ISBN\n2. The application should use a `Library` class to manage the collection of books, containing the following methods:\n\t* `addBook`: adds a new book to the library\n\t* `removeBook`: removes a book from the library by ISBN\n\t* `searchBook`: searches for a book by title or author\n\t* `displayBooks`: displays all books in the library\n\t* `saveData`: saves the library data to a file\n\t* `loadData`: loads the library data from a file\n3. The application should handle errors and exceptions properly, such as:\n\t* Invalid input (e.g., empty title or author)\n\t* Duplicate ISBN\n\t* Book not found\n4. The application should use a file to store and retrieve the library data, with the following format:\n\t* Each book is represented by a single line in the file, containing the title, author, and ISBN, separated by commas\n\n**Expected Deliverables:**\n\n1. A fully functional console-based application in C++ that meets the requirements and objectives of the task\n2. A `README.txt` file containing:\n\t* A brief description of the application and its functionality\n\t* Instructions on how to compile and run the application\n\t* A list of any assumptions or limitations made during the development process\n3.
